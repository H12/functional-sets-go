# Functional Sets

In this challenge you'll produce a Set. We're defining the `Set` as "a function
that accepts a number and returns a boolean." Or, in a fancier looking notation:

```
type Set = Function(Integer) => Boolean
```

## Constraints

Your Sets will only contain integers.

## Composability

As you produce functions, consider if they can be combined to implement others.
In other words, can you implement some function _in terms of_ another? Look for
and take advantage of these opportunities when appropriate.

## Tests

You'll need to write tests for each method you implement. You can run your tests
with `go test`.

## Release 1, Basic Operations

Define and test the following methods stubbed out in `sets.go`:

 * SingletonSet
 * Union
 * Intersect
 * Diff
 * Filter

## Release 2, Operating on Collections

You have the basic set operations, now we want operations that can operate on
the elements in the sets.

 * ForAll
 * Exists
 * Map
 * ToString

## Release 3, Bounded

You'll notice these methods only operate on bounded integers. Why is this
necessary? Describe your thoughts in `note.md`.
